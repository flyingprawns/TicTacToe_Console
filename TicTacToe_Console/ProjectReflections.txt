My first C# project, a very simple console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game.

It took about 6 hours to complete. My lack of experience slowed me down. I spent too much time thinking ahead and planning for features that I MIGHT need. Overthinking muddled my thought process and made simple tasks appear complicated. 

I'll get better with more experience. On to the next project.
